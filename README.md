# A prototype implementation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on the Ethereum blockchain.

This monorepo consists of two workspaces:

- `contracts` – smart contracts built on top of [OpenZeppelin governance](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/governance) in Hardhat development environment
- `web` – Next.js website interacting with deployed smart contracts

This project is part of the author's master's thesis. Deployed demo can be found [here](https://dao-prototype.vercel.app/).
